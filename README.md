# Bamboo HR Chrome (Edge) Extension

The BambooHR extension allows users to get extra information about their work month.
The extension displays the difference between available work hours and actual worked hours.
The extension will also inform the user about working days (and hours) this month.

When calculation difference extension will automatically deduce any vacation (or medical checkup) days, so the difference will be calculated on working days only.

When the calculation is triggered it will always include today (if a working day) so the real balance will be available only when working hours for today are entered.

The Extension for now only works for employees which work only on weekdays (it ignores weekends).

The installation process is described below.

## 1. Download

First you need to download the extension files. Files can be downloaded as the ZIP from [here](https://github.com/MSekrst/bamboo-extension/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
