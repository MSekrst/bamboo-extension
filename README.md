# Bamboo HR Chrome (Edge) Extension

**The BambooHR extension allows users to get extra information about their work month.**
The extension displays the difference between available work hours and actual worked hours.
The extension will also inform the user about working days (and hours) this month.

**The Extension will only work on the Timesheet page of a Bamboo HR.**

When calculation difference extension will automatically deduce any vacation (or medical checkup) days, so the difference will be calculated on working days only.

The Extension for now only works for employees which work only on weekdays (it ignores weekends).
